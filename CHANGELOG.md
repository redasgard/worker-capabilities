## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release

This is the first capability-aware workflow system for distributed systems, providing fault-tolerant coordination across multiple workers.

**Key Features:**
- **Capability-Aware**: Workers declare what they can do
- **Fault Tolerant**: Handles worker failures gracefully
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent API for workflow construction
- **Alternative Tools**: Fallback when primary tools unavailable
- **Distributed Coordination**: Handle worker failures gracefully
- **Async-First Design**: High-performance async workflows

**Security Features:**
- Capability-based security model
- Worker validation
- Workflow security
- Memory safety
- Type safety

**Testing:**
- 10 comprehensive tests
- Distributed system testing
- Fault tolerance testing
- Performance testing

## Migration Guide

### Getting Started

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. Here's how to get started:

```rust
use worker_capabilities::{CapabilityRegistry, WorkflowBuilder};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create capability registry
    let registry = CapabilityRegistry::new();
    
    // Register workers with capabilities
    registry.register_worker("analyzer-1", &["blockchain_analysis", "vulnerability_scan"]).await?;
    registry.register_worker("analyzer-2", &["static_analysis", "dynamic_analysis"]).await?;
    
    // Build workflow with alternatives
    let workflow = WorkflowBuilder::new()
        .add_step("analyze_code", "blockchain_analysis")
        .add_alternative("analyze_code", "static_analysis")
        .build()?;
    
    // Execute workflow
    let result = workflow.execute(&registry).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Workflow Construction

```rust
use worker_capabilities::WorkflowBuilder;

// Build complex workflow with alternatives
let workflow = WorkflowBuilder::new()
    .add_step("step1", "capability1")
    .add_step("step2", "capability2")
    .add_alternative("step1", "fallback_capability1")
    .add_alternative("step2", "fallback_capability2")
    .build()?;
```
